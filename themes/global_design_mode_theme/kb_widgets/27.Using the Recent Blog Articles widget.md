# Using the Recent Blog Articles widget

When you add the Recent Blog articles widget to a page you will see a list of recent blog articles that link to the full article. 

You can add the widget to a page's main content area or use a Sitewide Content area like a footer to have recent articles show up in there. 

The recent articles widget is particularly effective when added to a column in a multi column [Layout](#layouts-overview) area. 

You'll need to make sure you have [setup your main blog](#how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-website) system before the recent articles widget will function properly.
