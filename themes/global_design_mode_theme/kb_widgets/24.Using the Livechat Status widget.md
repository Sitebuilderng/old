# Using the Livechat Status widget

You can use the Livechat system to chat to visitors on your website using instant messages. 

Before your vistiors can start conversations with you, you need to add the Livechat Status widget to your page (this could be a Sitewide Content area like a Footer) and make sure you have your Livechat status set to Online in Website Settings > Livechat. You can also set your name and welcome message in Website Settings > Livechat too. 

Your livechat status will show as online whenever you are logged into the CMS and you status is set to online.
