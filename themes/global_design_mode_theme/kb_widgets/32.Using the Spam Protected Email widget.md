# Using the Spam Protected Email widget

When you add your email address to a website it's important to use some form of protection to avoid being spammed. The Spam Protected Email widget lets you display your email address without allowing it to be harvested by spam bots. 

Before you can use the Spam Protected Email widget you need to populate your email address by clicking Website Settings from the welcome screen then 'Social and contact'. Then click the 'Email link' item and add your email address. Once this is saved you can then add the Spam Protected Email widget anywhere you want your email address to display. 

If you want to change your email address in the future you can simply change the value in Website Settings. There's no need re-add the widget to your page.
