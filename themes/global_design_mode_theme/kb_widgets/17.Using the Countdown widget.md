# Using the Countdown widget

The countdown widget is a great widget that shows an animated countdown until a certain date and time in the future. 

Once you've added the Countdown widget to your page, you make it work by adding text containing the date and time of the target date. The format of this date and time is important. It should be added in this format:

YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS

For example, 28th June 2017 at 8pm would be added like this:

2017/06/28 20:00:00
