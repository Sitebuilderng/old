# Using the Copyright Notice widget

The Copyright Notice widget is an easy way to add a copyright notice to a footer area on your website. Typically your website will contain a footer area under Website Settings > Sitewide Content. ([Learn more about sitewide content here](#working-with-sitewide-content-areas))

Notice how in this example we've added our company name to the editable zone and the website is automatically adding the copyright symbol and the year at the beginning.
