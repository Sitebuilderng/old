# Using the Live Shopping Basket widget

The Live Shopping basket widget is a useful way to improve the user experience, particularly with larger pages with multiple products on the same page. 

It works best when added to a sidebar layout area on your page with the products in the main area. 

Start by adding a column [Layout](#layout-overview) item that includes a sidebar then click Insert > Widgets and drag the Live Shopping Basket widget into the sidebar zone for the layout item. 

<img src="help.php?img=liveshop.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=liveshop.png 2x"/>

Now you can use the Products system and add products and content to the 'Main content' zone in the layout item. Visitors will then be able to click the 'add to basket' button on the products. When they do this, they'll see their products add to the basket straight away without being redirected to the checkout page. 

You need to setup a (separate checkout page)[#creating-a-checkout-page] as well as using this widget.
