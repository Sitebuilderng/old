# Using the Floating Sub Menu widget

The Floating Sub Menu widget is a very powerful system that lets you create advanced interactive pages. 

## Here we are starting with a large page of content

## Defining your sections

For the Floating Sub Menu to work we need to define the different sections on our page with a small piece of code. To do this we use [Embed Codes](#add-embed-codes-to-your-pages). 

1. Add a new [embed code](#add-embed-codes-to-your-pages). 
2. Enter a name to help you recognise it, for example 'section 1'. 
3. Enter code like this in the code value: `<div id="section1"></div>` - Notice we have added 'section1' this is a unique text string that we'll use later. It mustn't contain any spaces or odd characters. 
4. Save the embed code by hitting esc then drag it to the location on your page, i.e just about the title of the 'section 1' on the page

## Add the widget

Once you've defined each section on your page using the above method, you can add the Floating Sub Menu widget itself. Click Insert > Widgets and drag the Floating Sub Menu widget to the very top of the editor. 

<img src="help.php?img=floating-sub-menu.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=floating-sub-menu.png 2x"/>

You can see the widget itself is very large and contains many editable zones. It can accomodate links to up to 10 separate sections. For each link there are three separate zones. For example for the first link there are the following zones:

1. Link1
2. Link1 Text
3. Link1 Icon

The way you populate these zones is best illustrated with an example:

<img src="help.php?img=floating-menu-3.gif"/>

Notice how we have added the unique section string from the 'Defining your sections' step 3 into the 'link#' zone, then some text for the visible link in "Link# Text" and an image for an icon in "Link# Icon". 

As you scroll the page the Floating Sub Menu will pin itself to the top of the window.
