# Using the Searchable Subpage Index widget

This is a powerful widget that is idea for letting your visitors quickly search a list of sub-pages that are also organised by category. 

First, setup a new main menu page and add subpages to it. The subpages will be your main categories. Then, add sub pages to each of the main category subpages. 

Then edit the top level page and add the Searchable Subpage widget by clicking Insert > Widgets then dragging it to your page.

Make sure each of your sub-sub pages have keywords added (edit the page, then click Page > Keywords) as it's the keywords that will be used to power the search mechanism. 

Here is an example. The animation shows the system as we edit the top level page. You can see in the live preview the sub pages (Cupboard items, Breads and Vegetables) and the sub sub pages belonging to them (Sweetcorn, Beans etc). Notice how the search mechanism is designed to highlight those sub sub pages only.
