# Using the Hover Image Button widget

The hover image button allows you to create a button out of an image that automatically fades to another image when the user hovers over it.

First prepare two images the same size; one to represent the normal state and one to represent the hover state. This works best if you use an image that basically stays the except perhaps for a different colour for the hover version.

<img src="help.php?img=hover-image.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=hover-image.png 2x"/>

Notice the first editable zone in the widget is called 'Main image and link'. This lets you decide where the image button will link to when clicked. You populate this value in the same way you make any other image into a link; just double click it and enter the link address.
