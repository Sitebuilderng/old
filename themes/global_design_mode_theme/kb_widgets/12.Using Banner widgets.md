# Using Banner Widgets

Banner widgets are a great way to add interactivity to your page as well as adding additional content to the same area of the page. 

There are three types of banner widget available: Banner Top, Banner Middle and Banner Bottom.

Each of the three banner widgets allows you to create a single slide for a banner by combining a background image with some other foreground content. When you add more than one banner widget consecutively on a page, they'll automatically combine to create an interactive slideshow on the page. 

The foreground content uses the full width of the banner slide so you can combine the normal left/center/right alignment tools with the three banner types to position your foreground in appropriate places according to the image you use. 

## Banner Top

The foreground content will be positioned at the top of the banner image. 

## Banner Middle

The foreground content will be positioned in the middle (vertically) of the banner image. 

## Banner Bottom

The foreground content will be positioned at the bottom of the banner image. 

## Example

Here you can see we have a banner made of two Banner widgets. The first is 'Banner Bottom' and the second is 'Banner Top'. You can see in the live preview how a slideshow has been created from the two banners.
