# Using the Social Links widgets

There are three social links widgets designed to display links to your social media profiles. If you edit a page and then click Insert > Widgets you'll see the *Social Links Left*, *Social Links Right* and *Social Links* widgets. The only difference between them is the alignment of the icons when shown on the page. 

To setup your social media profile links, click 'Website Settings' from the welcome screen and then click 'Social and Contact'. You can click any of the social profiles in that list and paste in the link to your pages. Only links that are populated will show on your site.
