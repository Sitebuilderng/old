# Using the Popup Message widget

The Popup Message widget lets you display a message to visitors when they first visit your website. 

If you add the Popup Message widget to a sitewide content area, the message will show to all visitors whichever page they first visit (i.e from search engines). Once a visitor has seen the message once it will not pop up again for them in that session. 

If you add the Popup Message widget to an individual page, the message will only show to visitors when they view that particular page. 

You can add as many popup messages to your website as you like as long as no single page has more than one that would try and show. For example, if you add one to a sitewide content area, you can't add any others to any other pages. However, if you add one directly to the content area of a page, you can then add a different one to another page. 

Each popup will maintain its own 'seen' status so the user will be shown each popup once. 

After deciding if you want to add the popup to all pages (by using a Sitewide Content area) or an individual page (by adding to the editor when editing a page), go ahead and click 'Insert' then 'Widgets' then drag the Popup Message widget on to the editing area. 

You can then drag or add new content into the 'Message content' zone. This is the content that displays in the popup.
