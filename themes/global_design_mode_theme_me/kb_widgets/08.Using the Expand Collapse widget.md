# Using the Expand Collapse Section widgets

The Expand Collapse Section widget creates a fun and interactive way to add content to a page and let your visitors quickly scan headings and click them to read more about a topic. 

When a visitor clicks a heading, the previously expanded section collapses and the clicked one expands to show the content.

Here you can see how this is set up on a page. 

You can see we add a new Expand Collapse Section widget to the editor for each item you want to add to the page. Widgets should be added consecutively. Each widget has its own area for the clickable title and the expanding content section.
