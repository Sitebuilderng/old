# Using breadcrumb widgets

If you want to add a breadcrumb trail to a page to show users the ancestor pages of their current page, you can use the Breadcrumb widgets.

There are two kinds of Breadcrumb widget. The 'Breadcrumb' widget will show the website's homepage as the first item in the breadcrumb trail, and 'Breadcrumb without home' will hide the homepage item from the trail. 

You need to add this widget to each page that you'd like it to appear on. 

Here's an example showing what the 'Breadcrumb' widget looks like. You can see the text added to the 'Intro text' editable zone shows up at the start of the breadcrumb. 

<img src="help.php?img=breadcrumb.png&amp;halfsize=true" srcset="help.php?img=breadcrumb.png 2x"/>
