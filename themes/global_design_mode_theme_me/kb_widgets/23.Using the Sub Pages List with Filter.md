# Using the Sub Pages List with Filter

The Sub Pages List with Filter is a very powerful widget that lets you build an index of pages along with a filter tool to let visitors refine the list of pages.

First, create a top level page which will be the 'parent' page. You then add subpages to this page which will be the list of pages that will be filterable. 

The way in which you add the meta data to each page to allow the filters to work is as follows:

Edit one of the subpages then click Page > Keywords. Then enter text in this format:

`Category: Value, Category: Value`

For example:

`Color: Red, Size: Small`

You would then edit another of your sub pages and add something like this:

`Color: Blue, Size: Medium`

The parent page will then automatically use these categories and values to create the filter tools.

In this example, we're looking at the parent page that has the Sub Pages List with Filter widget already added. The page has three subpages added (Cupboard Items, Breads, Vegetable) and each of those pages has the meta keywords values populated as per the example above. This is resulting in the filter generating itself for 'Color' and 'Size'. It's possible to create any number of filter categories.
