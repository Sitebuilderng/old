# Using the Searchable Preview Based Subpage Index widget

This widget is one of the most powerful widgets at your disposal and allows you to display an interactive index based on the subpages that below to the page you add the widget to. 

For example, let's say you have a main menu page called 'Products' and you add several sub-pages to the Products page. You can edit the Products page and add the Searchable Preview Based Subpage Index widget to it (Insert > Widgets, then drag it onto the page). 

**Important**
This widget is designed to work on a parent page that has a single list of subpages. Consider the '[Searchable Subpage Index](#using-the-searchable-sub-page-index-widget)' widget if you want to display a sub-categorised list of pages.

Then, edit each of the product subpages in turn and populate the 'Page Preview'. Think of these bits of content as small snippets that will show on the index page but won't actually show on the page itself. The idea is you'd keep them quite small, maybe just a title and introductory paragraph. 

Here you can see an example of how the widget is configured on the parent page. In this example, the page that is currently being edited has three sub-pages belonging to it.

## Keywords

To get the search mechanism working you need to populate each of the subpages with keywords. Do this by editing the subpages one by one and clicking the 'Page' menu and then 'Keywords'. Add a list of keywords separated by commas. 


The keywords you add here will be used to power the search feature on the website. When the visitor searches in the search box on the page you add the widget to, it will be matched against these keywords and the list will update as they search to only show the matching pages.
