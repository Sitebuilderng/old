# Using the Carousel Slide widgets

**When to use Carousel Slide widgets**

When you add a series of consecutive carousel slide widgets to your page, they will turn into an interactive slideshow.

There are two Carousel Slide widgets available in the system. The only difference between them is that one will advance automatically and the other will stay showing the current slide until the user advances the slideshow. 

In this example you can see how we've added two Carousel Slide widgets to the page and added a mixture of content into the editable zone. The live preview in the example is showing the first slide. A user would then able to able to click the controls below the slide to change to the second slide.
